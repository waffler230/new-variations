Some say the world will end in 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;r
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,
<p>Some say in</p> 
<br>i
<br>c
<br>e
<br>.
<p>From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire
I hold with those who favor fire.
But if it had to perish &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</p>
<p>I think I know enough of hate
To say that for destruction ice
Is also great
And would suffice.</p>
