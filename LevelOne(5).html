Some<Br> say the world will end<Br> <Br>in fire,
    <Br>Some say<Br> in <Br>i&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e<Br>.
From what Iâ€™ve tasted of <Br>desire
<p>I hold with those who favor fire.
But if it had to perish <Br>twice,
I t&nbsp;h&nbsp;i&nbsp;n&nbsp;k&nbsp; I k&nbsp;&nbsp;n&nbsp;&nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp;w&nbsp; enough of <Br>hate
To say that for destruction ice</p>
Is also <Br>great
And would suffice.
